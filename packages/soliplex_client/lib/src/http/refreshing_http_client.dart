/// Wraps an inner client to provide:
/// - Proactive refresh before requests when token is expiring soon
/// - Reactive refresh and retry on 401 responses (once only per request)
/// - Concurrent refresh deduplication via Completer
///
/// ## Concurrent Refresh Handling
///
/// When multiple requests receive 401 simultaneously, only one refresh
/// call is made. Other requests wait on the same Completer. The Completer
/// is cleared synchronously before completing to ensure subsequent requests
/// start fresh refresh attempts if needed.
