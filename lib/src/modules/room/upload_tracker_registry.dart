/// Module-scoped registry that hands out one `UploadTracker` per
/// `(serverId, roomId)`.
///
/// Trackers must outlive the widgets that mount them — an upload
/// started on the room-info screen may complete *after* the user taps
/// back, which would orphan a per-screen tracker. This registry is
/// constructed once in `room_module.dart` (alongside
/// `AgentRuntimeManager` and `RunRegistry`) and threaded into
/// `RoomScreen` and `RoomInfoScreen` so both read from the same
/// underlying tracker instance.
///
/// Eviction: the registry subscribes to `ServerManager.servers` and
/// disposes every tracker whose `serverId` disappears from that map
/// (typically when the user disconnects a server). All remaining
/// trackers are disposed when the registry itself is disposed.
///
/// Lifetime: the registry is process-scoped by design. Production
/// shell teardown does not call [dispose]; an upload started on one
/// screen must survive navigation to another, which the per-server
/// eviction path already handles. [dispose] exists for tests and for
/// the per-tracker cleanup invoked from eviction.
